        <h1>Something About Me!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Cüneyt Ekrem ARI. I'm from Turkey. I live in Ankara. Graduated from Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University as a Mechanical Engineer.
            <br> <br>
            During my university years, I was the president of the R&D Club for 2 years. I have
            gained great experience in terms of teamwork and team management with the projects,
            activities we have carried out during this period. After graduating from university, I went
            to Portugal with Erasmus as a mechanical engineer. I worked a factory which is working
            in the aluminium sector. I have had experience in areas such as product production
            tracking, technical drawing, product line development. I have gained significant
            experience in brand relations and product management in the field of media purchasing
            and planning in the company where I currently work.
            <br> <br>
            Research, product development, using computer tools have been a big part of my work.
            In these years, which are the beginning of my career, I quickly grasp anything that I don't
            know or lack. I use Microsoft Office programs to a good extent. I have professional level
            English. I also take software courses to improve myself, and I like to take courses in
            different fields again and always add new achievements to myself.
            <br> <br>
            Thank you for your time and consideration.
            <br> <br> <br>
            Sincerely,
            <br> <br>
            Cüneyt Ekrem ARI
